The two files collectively help in creating a multi-client, single server chat application.

The program runs on python version 2.7
The libraries required are the basic libraries that come with the version. To enlist them: sys, argparse, os, threading, socket, pickle
The program can be run on the basic terminal of an OS that has python installed. To run a server or each new client, open a different terminal window.

The steps to run the application are:

First run the ChatServer.py file while giving the port to which the server is to be connected as input.

Ex: python ChatServer.py -sp 9090

After the server is up and running, run the ChatClient.py file while giving three parameters as input to sign-in:

Ex: python ChatClient.py -u Alice -sip server-ip -sp 9090

Where,
-u is the Username of client
-sip is the IP address of the server the client wishes to connect.
-sp is the port number of the server.

The chat application can recognize two kinds of commands on the client’s end. They are:
1. list – lists the names of all the clients connected to the server currently.
Ex: list  
<– Signed In Users: Bob, Carole
2. send – sends the message from the current client to the client whose name is given as input along with the message.
Ex: send Carole Hello this is Alice.


The client will receive messages from another client in this format:
<– <From IP:PORT:Carole>: Hi Alice! How are you
